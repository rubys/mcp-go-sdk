## üìã Context Setup Prompt

Use this at the start of your Claude Code session:

```markdown
I'm developing with the Go MCP SDK (github.com/rubys/mcp-go-sdk), a high-performance Go implementation of the Model Context Protocol.

Key SDK Features:
- 7x+ faster than TypeScript MCP SDK
- 100% TypeScript SDK compatibility
- Concurrent, goroutine-based architecture
- Supports stdio, SSE, WebSocket, HTTP transports
- Production-ready with comprehensive testing

Documentation:
- API Docs: docs/API.md
- Migration Guide: docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
- Examples: docs/EXAMPLES.md
- Performance Guide: docs/PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md

Please help with Go MCP SDK development using best practices for performance and concurrency.
